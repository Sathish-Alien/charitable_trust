            A Hindu temple, or Devasthana or mandir or koil or kovil in Indian
            languages,[a] is a house, seat and body of divinity for Hindus. It
            is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together
            through worship, sacrifice, and devotion.[3][4] The symbolism and
            structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions,
            deploying circles and squares.[5] It also represents recursion and
            the representation of the equivalence of the macrocosm and the
            microcosm by astronomical numbers, and by "specific alignments
            related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of
            the deity and the patron".[6][7] A temple incorporates all elements
            of the Hindu cosmos — presenting the good, the evil and the human,
            as well as the elements of the Hindu sense of cyclic time and the
            essence of life — symbolically presenting dharma, artha, kama,
            moksha, and karma.[8][9][10]
